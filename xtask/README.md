This package contains parts of the build system as a CLI tool. It follows the convention defined in https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask that were inspired by the [Make your own make](https://matklad.github.io/2018/01/03/make-your-own-make.html)
blog post.

Over time we will move the script parts of `Make.toml` here, and maybe ultimately stop using `cargo-make` altogether.
