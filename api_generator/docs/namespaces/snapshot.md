Snapshot APIs

[Manage snapshots taken from a running Elasticsearch cluster](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/modules-snapshots.html).
A snapshot is a backup of individual
indices or the entire cluster, stored in a repository on a shared filesystem or a remote repository
on S3, HDFS, Azure, Google Cloud storage, and more.
