Snapshot Lifecycle Management APIs

[Manage policies for the time and frequency of automatic snapshots](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/snapshot-lifecycle-management-api.html).
Snapshot Lifecycle Management (SLM)
is related to [Index Lifecycle Management](../ilm/index.html), however, instead of managing a lifecycle of
actions that are performed on a single index, SLM allows configuring policies spanning multiple
indices. Snapshot Lifecycle Management can also perform deletion of older snapshots based on a
configurable retention policy.
