Enrich APIs

Manage [enrich policies](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ingest-enriching-data.html#enrich-policy)
that can be used by the [enrich processor](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/enrich-processor.html)
as part of an [ingest pipeline](../ingest/index.html), to add data from your existing indices
to incoming documents during ingest.
