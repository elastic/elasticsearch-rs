# Skip file of features and tests to skip.
# This is used at compilation time, when compiling tests from the YAML tests, to not generate tests that match
# on name or features defined below that should be skipped. Accordingly, changing values in this file requires
# recompiling tests in order for the changes to take effect.

# features not yet implemented
features:
  - node_selector
