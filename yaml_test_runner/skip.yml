# Skip file of features and tests to skip.
# This is used at compilation time, when compiling tests from the YAML tests, to not generate tests that match
# on name or features defined below that should be skipped. Accordingly, changing values in this file requires
# recompiling tests in order for the changes to take effect.

# features not yet implemented
features:
  - node_selector
  - contains
  - stash_path_replace
  - embedded_stash_key

# tests to skip generating and compiling a test for.
# Take the form of the generated path e.g.
# generated::xpack::security::hidden_index::_13_security_tokens_read::tests::test_get_security_tokens_index_metadata
tests:
  # this test returns the CA cert before the cert, so always fails
  - generated::xpack::ssl::_10_basic::tests::test_get_ssl_certificates

  # this test always returns "exponential_avg_checkpoint_duration_ms": 0.0 . seems like it might be missing data in
  # the setup, fires quicker than any documents are processed, or the delay of 1m is too high?
  - generated::xpack::transform::_transforms_stats_continuous::tests::test_get_continuous_transform_stats

  # this test always returns 3 buckets where 1 is expected
  - generated::xpack::ml::_jobs_get_result_overall_buckets::tests::test_overall_buckets_given_overall_score_filter
