# Skip file of features and tests to skip.
# This is used at compilation time, when compiling tests from the YAML tests, to not generate tests that match
# on name or features defined below that should be skipped. Accordingly, changing values in this file requires
# recompiling tests in order for the changes to take effect.

# features not yet implemented
features:
  - node_selector
  - contains
  - stash_path_replace
  - embedded_stash_key

# tests to skip generating and compiling a test for
tests:
  xpack/ssl/10_basic.yml:
    # this test returns the CA cert before the cert, so always fails
    - "Test get SSL certificates"

  xpack/transform/transforms_stats_continuous.yml:
    # this test always returns "exponential_avg_checkpoint_duration_ms": 0.0 . seems like it might be missing data in
    # the setup, fires quicker than any documents are processed, or the delay of 1m is too high?
    - "Test get continuous transform stats"
